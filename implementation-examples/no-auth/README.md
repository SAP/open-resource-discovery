## Node.js Without Authentication

This directory contains a `server.js` file that can be executed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en):

`node implementation-examples/no-auth/server.js`

It has no external dependencies (like a backend framework) and shows how little code needs to be written to implement an ORD API.

In a realistic scenario, the use of a backend framework is recommended, especially if it is already there.
