 * or to an [ORD ID] of an entity type.
 * It is assumed that the entity types are described in more detail or on a different abstraction level via metadata.
 * When the correlation ID is used, an ORD consumer may need to know how to access the entity type metadata through conventions.
 * This can be determined either by the namespace of the correlation ID,
 * or through a defined and known `implementationStandard` that can resolve the `localId` fragment of the correlation ID .
 *
 * At SAP, the metadata about entity types could be retrieved via the CSN_EXPOSURE service.
