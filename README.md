# Open Resource Discovery Specification

![Open Resource Discovery Logo](./static/img/open-resource-discovery-logo-wide.png 'Open Resource Discovery Logo')

## Summary

Open Resource Discovery (ORD) is a protocol that standardizes how metadata about application resources can be published and discovered.

It is an open standard by SAP, currently geared towards the SAP ecosystem. We have tried to build the standard in a way that we can evolve it into a general purpose standard in the future.

**To learn more, have a look at the [Open Resource Discovery Specification](https://sap.github.io/open-resource-discovery/) documentation.**

## Communication, Feedback & FAQ

If you have feedback, questions or problems, please create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SAP/open-resource-discovery/issues).

## Ownership and Governance

The ORD development is driven by SAP internally, but public feedback, suggestions and contributions are welcome.

## Resources

### Learning Material
