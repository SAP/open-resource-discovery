# Open Resource Discovery Specification

![Open Resource Discovery Logo](./static/img/open-resource-discovery-logo-wide.png 'Open Resource Discovery Logo')

## Summary

Open Resource Discovery (ORD) is a protocol that **allows applications and services to self-describe their exposed resources and capabilities**.
It can be used to describe static documentation, but can also reflect tenant specific configuration and extensions (at run-time).​

**To learn more, have a look at the [Open Resource Discovery Specification](https://sap.github.io/open-resource-discovery/) documentation.**

> ℹ ORD is an open standard by SAP, currently geared towards the SAP ecosystem.
> However, it is built to be a generic standard and could be used outside of SAP, if the infrastructure (aggregators, namespace registry) is built or adjusted.
> The standard is extensible through extensibility attributes, custom types and policy levels.
