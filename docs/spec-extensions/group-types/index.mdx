# Global Group Types

[Groups](../spec-v1/interfaces/document#group) and the corresponding [Group Types](../spec-v1/interfaces/document#group-type) can be used to define and apply your own taxonomy in a generic, extensible way.
See also [Grouping and Bundling](../details/articles/grouping-and-bundling#groups) detail page for more information.

There are a group types and group instances that are global and usually pre-defined by a central group.
Global means that any ORD provider or consumer may be interested in using or understanding them, not just a particular application or service.
