# SAP CMP mTLS Access Strategy (v1.0)

## Description

This is an SAP internal access strategy that is used for publishing to the Unified Customer Landscape (UCL), which can describe a customer system landscape incl. the runtime perspective.

The UCL was previously known as Central Management Plane (CMP), which is why the access strategy ID has `cmp` inside of it.

The [Specification ID](../../spec-v1/index.md#specification-id) for it is: `sap:cmp-mtls:v1`.
