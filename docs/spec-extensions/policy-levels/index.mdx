# ORD Policy Levels

This section contains the documentation for the standardized ORD `policyLevel` choices.

The policies are versioned independently of the ORD spec.
As a consequence the validity of an ORD document is a separate concern as the compliance of the ORD document with the chosen policy. Changes in the policy MAY lead to compliance issues.
