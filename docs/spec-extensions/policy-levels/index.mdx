# ORD Policy Levels

This section contains the documentation for the standardized ORD `policyLevels` choices.

The policies are versioned independently of the ORD spec.
As a consequence the validity of an ORD document is a separate concern as the compliance of the ORD document with the chosen policy. Changes in the policy MAY lead to compliance issues.

A policy level uses an [Specification ID](../../spec-v1/index.md#specification-id) as identifier.
This allows everyone to define their own policy levels locally or centrally.
