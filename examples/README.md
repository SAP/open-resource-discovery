# Example Files

This folder contains example ORD Documents and ORD Configs.

Please note that some of the examples are constructed to showcase certain features of ORD.
They do not work as a 1:1 copy template. For example, the namespaces need to be customized.

## File naming convention

All files in this folder will be used for example documentation and will also be validated.

All ORD Documents MUST start with `document-` and all ORD Configs with `configuration-`.
The file extension must be `.json`, so they are considered for documentation and validation.

Files with `.jsonc` extension can be created for PoC / prototyping purposes, but they will essentially be ignored.
