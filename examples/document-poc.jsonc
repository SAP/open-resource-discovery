  // This document demonstrates that we can also write .jsonc (JSON with Comments) examples.
  // JSONC can be helpful for PoCs where we start with writing example ORD documents with additional explanations.
  // Please note that this is not supported for a real productive implementation, where only plain JSON is allowed.
  // The API Metadata Validator will also not support JSONC, but we'll have VSCode internal code intelligence and schema validation.
  // .jsonc documents in this folder will be ignored when validating examples files.
